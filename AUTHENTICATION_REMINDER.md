# Authentication Reminder

## ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: Authentication Bypass Implemented

### What was changed:
1. **AuthGuard.jsx** - Modified to allow browsing without authentication
   - Users can now access the main dashboard without signing in
   - Authentication is only required for:
     - `/settings`
     - `/booking` 
     - `/profile`
     - `/my-bookings`

2. **HostelCard.jsx** - Updated booking functionality
   - "Book Now" button now checks for authentication
   - "Wishlist" button now checks for authentication
   - Redirects to login if user is not authenticated

3. **RoomFilter.jsx** - Updated room selection
   - "Select Room" button now checks for authentication
   - Redirects to login if user is not authenticated

### ðŸ”„ TO RESTORE FULL AUTHENTICATION:

1. **Revert AuthGuard.jsx** back to requiring authentication for all routes except login/signup
2. **Remove authentication checks** from individual components (HostelCard, RoomFilter)
3. **Test thoroughly** to ensure proper authentication flow

### Current Behavior:
- âœ… Users can browse listings without signing in
- âœ… Users can view hostel details without signing in
- âœ… Users are prompted to login only when trying to:
  - Book a room
  - Add to wishlist
  - Access settings/profile

### Files Modified:
- `/service/AuthGuard.jsx`
- `/src/components/dashboard/HostelCard.jsx`
- `/src/components/details/RoomFilter.jsx`

**Remember to restore authentication requirements when ready for production!**
